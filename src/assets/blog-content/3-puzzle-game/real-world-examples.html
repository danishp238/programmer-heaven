            <p>At first glance, a drag-and-drop puzzle game may look like simple fun. But behind that simplicity lies
                logic that mirrors real-world software applications. Let‚Äôs explore how puzzle-like problem-solving is
                used in everyday tech and business fields.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üîÑ 1. Drag-and-Drop in UI Builders</h2>
            <p>Ever used tools like WordPress, Wix, or Webflow? Their interfaces allow you to drag and drop elements to
                build a site. The underlying tech works almost exactly like our puzzle game‚Äôs logic: draggable elements
                + droppable targets + position tracking.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üèóÔ∏è 2. Construction and Architecture</h2>
            <p>3D modeling tools for architects and engineers use puzzle-style placement logic to snap walls, doors, or
                furniture into place. These tools rely on grid-based layouts and snapping logic ‚Äî just like a puzzle
                board!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üì¶ 3. Warehouse and Inventory Optimization</h2>
            <p>Companies like Amazon use algorithms similar to puzzle-solving to decide where to place items in a
                warehouse for quick retrieval. Think of each product as a puzzle piece needing the perfect slot for
                efficiency.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üß† 4. AI and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Solving logic puzzles helps train algorithms. Developers feed neural networks logical puzzles to
                strengthen pattern recognition. For example, visual CAPTCHA tests are essentially a puzzle for AI to
                solve.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üöó 5. Navigation Systems</h2>
            <p>When Google Maps calculates a route, it's essentially solving a puzzle of connected roads, finding the
                most efficient path among many. It applies similar logic to piecing together the shortest, fastest
                combination.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">Next time you build a puzzle game, remember: you're not just coding a toy ‚Äî you're
                simulating real-world logic used in some of the biggest industries in the world!</p>
