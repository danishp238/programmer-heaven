            </h1>
            <p>Puzzle games aren’t just fun to play — they’re secretly training your brain like a champ! Whether you’re
                matching shapes, solving logic sequences, or dragging puzzle pieces into place, these little games pack
                a big cognitive punch.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">🧠 Puzzle Games Improve Memory</h2>
            <p>While playing puzzle games, your brain recalls the shapes, strategies, or patterns needed to solve the
                puzzle. This repetition strengthens neural connections, making it easier to retain information over
                time.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">🎯 Enhances Focus and Patience</h2>
            <p>Unlike action games, puzzles require sustained concentration. You often need to sit and think about each
                piece. This helps develop patience, an essential trait for coding and problem-solving in real life.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">📊 Puzzle Solving Is a Workout for the Mind</h2>
            <p>Just like lifting weights builds muscle, solving puzzles challenges areas of the brain responsible for
                logic, reasoning, and spatial awareness. That’s why puzzles are used in cognitive therapy, classrooms,
                and even job interviews!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">🤹‍♀️ It Boosts Your Mood</h2>
            <p>Completing a puzzle releases dopamine, the feel-good chemical. That’s why you often feel satisfied after
                solving a level — your brain is literally rewarding you for your effort!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">🎮 Why Developers Love Puzzle Games</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
